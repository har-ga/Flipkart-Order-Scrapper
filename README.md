# Flipkart-Order-Scrapper
This is the code for a technical club project(3D Club - NIT, Rourkela) for which I was assigned as the Project Head. 

This code makes a user login into the flipkart account using Chrome automation and then scrape the orders of that user and convert it into pandas dataframe with date title, category, status of order, and price.
